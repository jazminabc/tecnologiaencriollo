Technology in Criollo is born with the intention of publicly sharing technology information that I find interesting, the tools I use in my daily life, and maintaining a kind of "field journal" with technical resources, personal project tracking, and occasional courses I've developed.
All knowledge available here is free for you to use, with the sole condition that you use it for good, improving your own living conditions and those of the people around you.
After all, it's nothing more than an honor-based pledge, which isn't even reflected in the site's license or in the code I might share. But it's important to fulfill it. So please, I don't want to catch you misusing anything that comes from here...
